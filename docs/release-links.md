The latest outing chart update was published 1 November 2026 from source commit
`c9c3348`. The range shading now begins at the selected outing start boundary;
UV samples still follow their Open-Meteo hour intervals. The Android update
uses channel `preview`, runtime `1.0.0`.

The website branding was then restored from source commit `240037e`: the
loading logo and PWA icons again use the original solid stone background.
The new Android APK embeds the current UI and restored loading logo, keeping
runtime `1.0.0` and incrementing the Android version code to 2.

Existing APK installations receive these UI changes through Expo Update.
Open the app with an internet connection, allow the update to download, then
fully close and reopen it. Installing the new APK is required to change the
native loading logo; uninstalling the existing app first is unnecessary.
Chrome may retain the previous installed website icon until its manifest
refreshes. Removing and re-adding the website shortcut picks up the current
icon when the old one persists.

The install link is specific to a build; share the newest one with Android users.
See [`mobile-release.md`](mobile-release.md) for install and update details.
